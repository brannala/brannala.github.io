## Programming
**Lex and Yacc**

Lex and yacc (now flex and bison) can be used to write a lexer and parser for such things as configuration files, trees in newick format, and so on. A basic tutorial is available [here](http://ds9a.nl/lex-yacc/cvs/output/lexyacc.html#toc2.1 "Lex and YACC primer"). There are also detailed manuals for [flex](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/flex-2.5.4/html_mono/flex.html "flex manual") and [bison](http://www.gnu.org/s/bison/manual/bison.html "bison manual").

**Autotools**

This is a suite of gnu tools for creating portable source code distributions. A great tutorial can be found [here]( http://fsmsh.com/2753 "Autotools tutorial"). The definitive “goat” book on autotools and libtools can be found online [here](http://sourceware.org/autobook/autobook/autobook.html#SEC_Top ""Goat" book").

**getopt**

This is a gnu standard library that is incredibly useful for parsing command line options. It is best used with the gcc/c++ compiler. A brief description is found [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt.html#Getopt "getopt").

**Git**

Git (git) is a great tool for maintaining prior versions of your source code (or manuscripts) in an organized hierarchy. A free book on git is [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). A quick reference is [here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf). Open source projects can be hosted for free on [github](https://github.com/) and private repositories for academic research (with some limitations) can be hosted on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). I use both. Projects on github can have web pages (gitpages) hosted as well. This website is hosted on github 

**LaTeX**

This program (derived from Don Knuth’s TeX program) is ideal for writing manuscripts that use a lot of equations. I wrote my PhD in LaTeX and so have most of my graduate students. A tutorial, list of symbols, etc, can be found [here](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Basics "LaTeX").

## Bioinformatics
**NGS data file formats**

The FASTQ format appears to be emerging as a standard for next-generation sequencing data (particularly Illumina GAII reads). The Wikipedia description of the format is [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format "FASTQ").

**NCI wiki**

This [wiki](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/TCGA+barcode#TCGAbarcode-types "NCI barcodes") explains barcoding scheme and other features of cancer genome databases such as [GCAT](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/ "Cancer Genome Atlas").

**Proggy fonts**

These are my favorite terminal fonts. Available [here](http://www.proggyfonts.com/index.php?menu=download "Proggy Fonts").
