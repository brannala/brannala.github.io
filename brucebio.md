# Bruce Rannala
I was born in New Westminster, British Columbia in 1964 -- the Year of the Dragon. The Vietnam war, Beatlemania and the Civil Rights Movement in the US were in overdrive
that Spring, which is interesting but was probably irrelevant to my situation. My father Ivar Rannala had emigrated to Canada with my grandmother (Ines)  and uncle (Ray) in the 1950s, arriving by ship 
in Halifax (from Sweden) and travelling across 
Canada by train to Vancouver. They were Estonian refugees who had fled Estonia in 1944 when it was occupied by the USSR. They spent several years in a refugee camp in Sweden
before emigrating to Canada. My grandmother's sister Berta was already living in Canada, having emigrated from Finland to British Columbia with her husband in the 1920s. Her
husband had fought with the Reds during the Finnish Civil War and was under threat of execution after the Whites were victorious. Berta was a sponsor of my grandmother's immigration
application. Many Finnish Communists emigrated to B.C. at that time often working in the fishing and logging industries and were active in the 
[Communist Party of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Canada). It is somewhat ironical that my grandmother who was fleeing communism was sponsored by
her sister who had come to Canada fleeing fascism. Despite this, my grandmother (who was born in Loviisa, Finland) remained a socialist in outlook and her second husband was a Ukranian immigrant longshoreman
who my father claimed was a card-carrying communist. My father's politics have always been very anti-communist (and anti-Soviet in particular) for obvious reasons.

I never met my paternal grandfather Alexander. He was accused of socialist activities and executed in the summer 1941 by an 
Estonian paramilitary group allied with the Nazi forces. That period of Estonian history is often called the "holocaust by bullets.'' Thousands of Estonians were executed 
that summer including virtually all the Jews that had remained in Estonia rather than leaving with the departing Soviet forces. Some years ago, I visited Estonia and my second 
cousin (also named Ivar) took me to a cross-road in the village of Vinistu where he said my grandfather had been forced to kneel and was shot. An old woman of the village who
lived nearby claims to have heard him pleading for his life on behalf of his young children. My father was 10 years old when Alexander died. We have an old photograph of my father
dressed in a sailor suit and standing solemly with my grandmother and two uncles. In front of them is the dressed corpse of my grandfather laid out on a table. His hands are folded 
over his chest and my grandmother's hand is resting on his. It is a beautiful photograph. Alexander was a rum-runner during the 1920s prohibition period smuggling Estonian vodka to Finland,
one of the so-called "vodka kings." That was how he met Ines, her brothers were business associates on the Finnish side. Ines was Finn-Swede and Alexander was Estonian-Swede so they
could initially converse only in Swedish. Ines became the bag-lady for the operation, travelling to retrieve and deposit cash payments for the goods. Despite being a vodka smuggler
(or perhaps as a consequence) Alexander reportedly did not drink strong liquor himself, nor did he smoke. 
Alexander and Ines did well enough to be able to afford to have their family farm in Vinistu and to spend winters
in an apartment in Tallin and send my uncles to secondary school at a French lycee there. I visited the little museum in Vinistu which has paraphenalia from the smuggling days and I found a photograph
of Alexander in one of the exhibits.

My father Ivar was 15 when the family came to Canada. He started school while a refugee in Sweden but eventually started skipping classes and dropped out because he said
the Swedish boys bullied the Estonians. So, he had little formal education beyond elementary school when he arrived in Canada and he spoke no english. He once told me that
he learned english by reading books using a dictionary. One consequence of this is that many of his pronunciations are incorrect and he passed these on to me by reading me books as a child.
At least that is the excuse that I use. Ines settled in East Vancouver where she worked as a seamstress in a textile factory. She eventually ran a boarding house as well before
buying a farmhouse with acreage and moving to the then-rural community of Port Coquitlam. My earliest memories of her are in the Port Coquitlam house. The smells of strong coffee
and pepparkaka -- there always seemed to be a bridge game going on and a lot of nice old people who all treated me like I was their own grandson.
