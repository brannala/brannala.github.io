## Bruce Rannala
I am a first generation university graduate and participate in the [#firstgen](http://firstgen.ucdavis.edu/) organization which aims to provide support and inspiration to
first generation college students attending UC Davis. Undoubtedly, I have faced fewer obstacles than many first-generation students. However, I hope that some aspects of my 
personal biography will speak to some of you and encourage you to continue pursuing your academic goals despite the obstacles.

# My parents
My father Ivar Rannala emigrated to Canada with his widowed mother (Ines) and brother in the 1950s. They arrived by ship 
at [Pier 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_21) in Halifax (from Sweden) and travelled across 
Canada by train to Vancouver. They were Estonian refugees who had fled Estonia in 1944 when it was occupied by the USSR. They spent several years in a refugee camp in Sweden
before emigrating to Canada. Ines' sister Berta was already living in Canada and sponsored her immigration application. Berta emigrated from Finland to British Columbia with her husband in the 1920s. He
had fought with the Reds during the Finnish Civil War and was under threat of reprisals after the Whites' victory. It is perhaps ironical that Ines, who was fleeing Soviet communism, was sponsored
by Berta who had come to Canada as a communist fleeing fascism.

I never met my paternal grandfather Aleksander. He was accused of socialist activities and executed in the summer 1941 by an 
Estonian paramilitary group allied with the Nazi forces. That period of Estonian history, when [Nazi Germany invaded Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Estonia_during_World_War_II)
pushing out the [occupying Soviet forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Baltic_states), is often called the "holocaust by bullets.'' 
That summer, thousands of Estonians were executed including virtually all the Jews who had remained in 
Estonia rather than leaving with the departing Soviet forces. 
My father was 7 years old when his father died. 
Aleksander had been a rum-runner in the coastal village of [Viinistu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viinistu) where my father grew up. 
During the [1920s prohibition period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition#Nordic_countries) he smuggling Estonian vodka by sea to Finland.
As one of the so-called "Vodka Kings," Alexander did well enough for he and Ines to have their family farm in Viinistu while spending winters
in the capital Tallin where my uncles attended secondary school at a French lycee. 
He met his wife-to-be Ines through her brothers who were business associates on the Finnish side. 

Ines settled in East Vancouver where she worked as a seamstress in a textile factory. She operated a boarding house as well before
buying a farmhouse with acreage and moving to the then-rural community of Port Coquitlam.
My father Ivar was 15 when the family came to Canada. He had started school while a refugee in Sweden but began skipping classes and then dropped out because
of bullying the Swedish boys inflicted on the Estonians. He had little formal education beyond elementary school when he arrived in Canada and he spoke no English. He once told me that
he learned English by reading books with the help of a dictionary. One consequence is that many of his pronunciations are incorrect and he passed these on to me by reading out loud
to me when I was a child.
At least that is the excuse that I use. 

At 16, my father Ivar began working as a crew hand (eventually becoming a helmsman) on [Union Steamships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Steamship_Company_of_British_Columbia) 
delivering passengers and freight to 
the logging and mining camps of British Columbia. In his mid-twenties he completed a course as a radio technician and eventually specialized in selling and servicing radio equipment used by the logging industry.
My father married my mother Rayna at about this time. My maternal grandfather had emigrated to B.C. from Saskatchewan during the great depression. After earning a modest income as a gold miner working
claims on the Fraser River, he became a Millwright at the pulp and paper mill in Gibsons, B.C. My maternal grandmother developed
multiple sclerosis and my mother (being the eldest of 6 children) had to take on many of the domestic responsibilities at home; as a partial consequence she left school in grade 11.

# My childhood  
I was born in New Westminster, British Columbia in 1964. Shortly thereafter my family moved to the small isolated logging community of [Port McNeill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_McNeill) on Northern Vancouver Island. 
I attended school in Port McNeill. The schools at that time were not very good but we did have several excellent and dedicated teachers especially at the elementary level. I was not particularly studious,
however, and spent a lot of my time working after school. I was precocious and by age 11 had a job assembling toy exhibits at a department store. I switched to pumping gas and repairing tires at the
local Shell station when I was 12 and worked weekends entirely on my own which seems unthinkable now. I cannot remember ever having done homework as a child. I bought a 
motorcycle and, as was usual in that town, rode it unlicensed on the logging roads. I was involved in a motorcycle accident with a crew bus when I was 15 and sustained a 
compound fracture of both bones in my lower left leg. The injury was very serious and my parents and I were asked to choose between an amputation or a long and difficult surgery
that might not be successful. We chose surgery and I missed most of that school year as I was in and out of the hospital in Vancouver for the surgeries which were ultimately successful. 

# My early adulthood
I graduated from North Island Secondary School ([NISS](https://northislandsecondary.edublogs.org/)) in 1982. My graduating class included about 80 students, fewer than a dozen of whom went on to college.
In my senior years at NISS I enrolled in a pre-apprenticeship program in heavy-duty mechanics. I completed a work-study program in HD mechanics with a local logging company and 
successfully passed the Provincial pre-apprenticeship certification exam. Among other things, I know how to replace a worn track on a [Caterpillar D8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar_D8) 
bulldozer and can operate a [Caterpillar
966](https://www.cat.com/en_IN/products/new/equipment/wheel-loaders/medium-wheel-loaders/1000023498.html) articulated frame loader. This knowledge has actually proven quite useful when I need to service the old diesel engine on my sailboat.  Like many kids I was anxious to leave my small town and move to the nearest large city, which happened to be Vancouver. I somehow discovered that if I completed
my grade 12 English course by correspondence I could leave town 6 months before graduation, which is what I did. This was not the wisest decision I have made as I was late finishing my final English assignment;
had it not been for the efforts of my correspondence instructor to get the results to NISS in time, I would not have been able to graduate.

When I graduated from high school in 1982 the Canadian economy was in [deep recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession). It was the era of [Reaganomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics~) and a period of stagflation with the unemployment rate in Canada hitting 12%. I had worked part-time as a baker during high school and continued full-time after I
graduated. The following year I took a position as a logger ([chokerman](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chokerman)) for Kilpala Logging and worked "in the bush" for a year. It was a union job ([IWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Woodworkers_of_America)) so the wages were good and I managed to save some money which was helpful when I eventually went to university. In retrospect, I feel very fortunate to have survived the dangerous work environment of the "North Island" in those
years to pursue what has essentially been a second life in academia. Even during high school I lost many friends to logging and commercial fishing accidents.
   
# My undergrad at UBC
I was 21 years old when I started my first year of studies at the University of British Columbia. Since I did not have the formal pre-requisites to be admitted, I had
initially planned to attend college first and then transfer in third year. However, my girlfriend at the time had a recent degree from UBC and suggested that I apply 
directly to UBC as a mature student. This may have been somewhat self-interest on her part as it meant we would be living closer to one another. 
I applied as a mature student, wrote an entrance exam and was admitted. 
In retrospect, the advice was good as it allowed me a greater opportunity to get
to know my professors during my first two years which in turn allowed me to get involved in research projects as an senior undergraduate. I was initially pre-med. I don't remember my motivations except that I was
probably idealistic and felt drawn to a humanitarian profession. What I do remember is that I wanted to be in a position that did not require me to ask my clients to pay for my services.
Obviously that greatly restricted the possibilities. To be perfectly honest, I was completely unaware at that point that professors existed whose sole job was teaching and research. 

I did have a formative job experience the summer after my first year at university that changed my career goals. My father had worked as a volunteer paramedic for the B.C. Provincial Ambulance Service for many years.
The paramedics were trained through an intensive 2 week course called the Industrial First Aid Course and once they had this training they were eligible to serve as an ambulance attendant in a rural community. I took the
training program in Vancouver during the summer of 1986 and spent that summer on call for the ambulance service in Port McNeill. Although I was supposed to serve with an experienced paramedic on my
first few calls the only persons to show up for my first call were myself and a driver.  I had to handle the call on my own; the victim had a skull fracture and eventually had to be flown to Vancouver for neurosurgery.
That summer was an intensive education in trauma medicine. I would be on 24 hour call several days a week, carrying a pager. When the pager went off I had to rush down to the fire station to go out with the ambulance.
The pager always seemed to go off when I was in the shower. By the end of the summer I had lost all enthusiasm for medical school.
