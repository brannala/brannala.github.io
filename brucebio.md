## Bruce Rannala
I am a first generation university graduate and participate in the [#firstgen](http://firstgen.ucdavis.edu/) organization which aims to provide support and inspiration to
first generation college students attending UC Davis.  I provide my personal biography here in the hope that it may encourage students with unusual academic backgrounds to
pursue higher education. Undoubtedly, I have faced fewer obstacles than many first-generation students. However, I hope that some of my experiences will speak to some of
you and encourage you to continue pursuing your academic goals despite, or perhaps because of, those obstacles.

# My parents
My father Ivar Rannala emigrated to Canada with his mother (Ines) and brother in the 1950s. They arrived by ship 
at [Pier 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_21) in Halifax (from Sweden) and travelled across 
Canada by train to Vancouver. They were Estonian refugees who had fled Estonia in 1944 when it was occupied by the USSR. They spent several years in a refugee camp in Sweden
before emigrating to Canada. Ines' sister Berta was already living in Canada and sponsored her immigration application. Berta emigrated from Finland to British Columbia with her husband in the 1920s. He
had fought with the Reds during the Finnish Civil War and was under threat of reprisals after the Whites' victory. It is somewhat ironical that Ines, who was fleeing Soviet communism, was sponsored
by Berta who had come to Canada as a communist fleeing fascism.

I never met my paternal grandfather Alexander. He was accused of socialist activities and executed in the summer 1941 by an 
Estonian paramilitary group allied with the Nazi forces. That period of Estonian history is often called the "holocaust by bullets.'' Thousands of Estonians were executed 
that summer including virtually all the Jews that had remained in Estonia rather than leaving with the departing Soviet forces. My father was 7 years old when Alexander died. 
Alexander was a rum-runner in the coastal village of Vinistu during the 1920s prohibition period smuggling Estonian vodka by sea to Finland,
one of the so-called "Vodka Kings." That was how he met Ines, her brothers were business associates on the Finnish side. 
Alexander and Ines did well enough to be able to afford to have their family farm in Vinistu and to spend winters
in an apartment in Tallin and sent my uncles to secondary school at a French lycee there. 

My father Ivar was 15 when the family came to Canada. He started school while a refugee in Sweden but eventually started skipping classes and dropped out because he said
the Swedish boys bullied the Estonians. So, he had little formal education beyond elementary school when he arrived in Canada and he spoke no english. He once told me that
he learned english by reading books using a dictionary. One consequence of this is that many of his pronunciations are incorrect and he passed these on to me by reading me books as a child.
At least that is the excuse that I use. Ines settled in East Vancouver where she worked as a seamstress in a textile factory. She eventually ran a boarding house as well before
buying a farmhouse with acreage and moving to the then-rural community of Port Coquitlam. 

At 16, my father Ivar began working as a crew hand (eventually becoming a helmsman) on Pacific Steamships 
delivering passengers and freight to 
the logging and mining camps of British Columbia. In his mid-twenties he completed a course as a radio technician and eventually specialized in selling and servicing radio equipment used by the logging industry.
My father married my mother Rayna at about this time. My maternal grandfather emigrated to B.C. from Saskatchewan during the great depression, earning a modest income as a gold miner working
claims on the Fraser River. Eventually he became a Millwright at the pulp and paper mill in Gibsons, B.C. My mother Rayna attended school in Gibsons but my maternal grandmother developed
multiple sclerosis and my mother (being the eldest of 6 children) had to take on many of the domestic responsibilities at home -- as a partial consequence she left school in grade 11.

# My childhood  
I was born in New Westminster, British Columbia in 1964. My family moved to the small community of Port McNeill on Northern Vancouver Island shortly after I was born. I attended school in Port McNeill graduating from North Island Secondary School ([NISS](https://northislandsecondary.edublogs.org/)) in 1982.
The schools in Port McNeill at that time were not particularly good, but we did have several excellent and dedicated teachers, especially in the elementary school. I was not particularly studious,
however, and spent a lot of my time after school working. I was precocious and at age 11 started a job assembling toy exhibits at the local department store, then switched to pumping gas and repairing tires at the
local Shell station when I was 12. I worked weekends entirely on my own in that job which seems unthinkable now. I cannot remember ever having done homework as a child. At 15, I bought a 
motorcycle and (as was usual in that town) rode it unlicensed on the logging roads. I was involved in a motorcycle accident with a crew bus when I was 15 in which I sustained a 
compound fracture of both bones in my lower left leg. I missed most of the school year as I was in and out of the hospital in Vancouver for surgeries. 

# My early adulthood
In my senior years at NISS I enrolled in a pre-apprenticeship program in heavy-duty mechanics. I completed a work-study program in HD mechanics with a local logging company and 
successfully passed the Provincial pre-apprenticeship certification exam. Among other things, I know how to replace a worn track on a [Caterpillar D8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar_D8) 
bulldozer and can operate a [Caterpillar
966](https://www.cat.com/en_IN/products/new/equipment/wheel-loaders/medium-wheel-loaders/1000023498.html) articulated frame loader. This knowledge has actually proven quite useful when I need to service the old diesel engine on my sailboat.  Music is a long-standing interest of mine and like many kids I played in garage bands. During my final year of high school, I had become anxious to move to Vancouver where I could connect with older friends and pursue my music. I somehow discovered that if I completed
my grade 12 English course by correspondence I could finish 6 months early and leave town, which is what I did. This was not the best decision that I have made as I was late finishing my final assignment
and if it had not been for the efforts of my correspondence instructor to get the results to NISS prior to graduation I would not have graduated.

When I graduated in 1982 the Canadian economy was in [deep recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession). It was the era of [Reaganomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics~) and a period of stagflation with the unemployment rate in Canada hitting 12%. I had worked part-time as a baker during high school and continued full-time after I
graduated. The following year I took a position as a logger (chokerman) and worked "in the bush" for a year. It was a union job ([IWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Woodworkers_of_America)) so the wages were good and I managed to save some money which was helpful when I eventually went to university. In retrospect, I feel very fortunate to have survived the dangerous work environment of the "North Island" in those
years to pursue what has essentially been a second life in academia. Many good friends died in logging and commercial fishing accidents, even during high school.
   
# My undergrad at UBC
I was 21 years old when I started my first year of studies at the University of British Columbia. I did not have the formal pre-requisites to be admitted and
initially planned to attend college first and then transfer in third year. However, my girlfriend at the time who had recently finished a degree at UBC suggested that I apply as a mature
student and go straight to UBC. The advice may have been partly self-interest on her part as it meant I would be living closer to her. I applied as a mature student, wrote an entrance exam and was admitted. 
In retrospect, my girlfriend's advice was very good as it allowed me a greater opportunity to get
to know my professors during my first two years which in turn allowed me to get involved in research projects as an undergraduate. I was initially pre-med. I don't remember much of my motivation except that I was
probably idealistic at that age and drawn to some form of humanitarian profession. What I do remember is that I wanted to be in a position that did not require me to ask my clients to pay for my services.
Obviously that greatly restricted the possibilities. To be perfectly honest, I was completely unaware at that point that Professors existed whose sole job was teaching and research. 

I had a formative job experience the summer after my first year at university that changed my career goals. My father had worked as a volunteer paramedic for the B.C. Provincial Ambulance Service for many years.
The paramedics were trained through an intensive 2 week course called the Industrial First Aid Course and once they had this training they were eligible to serve as an ambulance attendant in a rural community. I took the
training program in Vancouver during the summer of 1986 and spent that summer on call for the ambulance service in Port McNeill. Although I was supposed to serve with an experienced paramedic on my
first few calls the only persons to show up for my first call were myself and a driver so I had to handle the call on my own (the victim had a skull fracture and eventually had to be flown to Vancouver for surgery).
That summer was an intensive education in trauma medicine. I would be on 24 hour call several days a week, carrying a pager. When the pager went off I had to rush down to the fire station to take out the ambulance.
The pager always seemed to go off when I was in the shower. By the end of the summer I had lost all enthusiasm for medical school.
