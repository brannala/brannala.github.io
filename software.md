## Actively Developed Software
# BayesAss Version 3 (BA3)
Software for inferring proportions of recent migrants among populations using multilocus genotype data. [Publications with Commentary]()

Current Release (Version 3.04) [Download](https://github.com/brannala/BA3/releases). 

BA3 Manual [Download](https://github.com/brannala/BA3/blob/master/doc/BA3Manual.pdf).

# Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP)
Software for inferring Bayesian posterior probabilities of phylogenetic trees and/or species delimitations and related parameters under a multi-species coalescent process. [Publications with Commentary]()

BPP  version 4 now under development at [github.com/bpp/](https://github.com/bpp/bpp).

Current stable release of command line program BPP (Version 3.4) [Download](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software.html).

# Graphical User Interface for BPP (BPPg)
A graphical user interface for the BPP program that allows visualization of the posterior distribution of species trees and provides tools for
preparing input files and running BPP. This is the first release of the program (version 0.2.0.a released 14.05.2017) and is not yet mature so every feature may not work and bugs exist.
