## Actively Developed Software
# BayesAss Version 3 (BA3)
Software for inferring proportions of recent migrants among populations using multilocus genotype data. [Publications with Commentary]()

Current Release (Version 3.04) [Download](https://github.com/brannala/BA3/releases). 

BA3 Manual [Download](https://github.com/brannala/BA3/blob/master/doc/BA3Manual.pdf).

# Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP)
Software for inferring Bayesian posterior probabilities of phylogenetic trees and/or species delimitations and related parameters under a multi-species coalescent process. [Publications with Commentary]()

BPP  version 4 now under development at [github.com/bpp/](https://github.com/bpp/bpp).

Current stable release of command line program BPP (Version 3.4) [Download](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software.html).

# Minimalist BPP
Web application to generate control and map files for the BPP program. Default priors for theta and tau are
specified using the uploaded sequence data. The average pairwise difference among sequences within populations specifies the prior mean of theta 
and the maximum pairwise difference specifies the prior mean of tau. Access the application here: [bpps](https://brannala.github.io/bpps/)


## Static Software (Supported but not developed)
# Disequilibrium Mapping and Likelihood Estimation (DMLE+)
Software for disequilibrium gene mapping and allele age estimation. [Publications with Commentary]()

[DMLE+ website](http://dmle.org/)

# Inference of Recombination Rates and Hotspots (InferRho)
Software for estimating recombination rates, gene conversion rates and recombination hotspot positions using Bayesian inference and the
full likelihood for genome-wide SNP data. [Publications with Commentary]()

Source code for InferRho version 1.0 [Download](http://rannala.org/programs/InferRho-1.0.tar.gz)

# oncoSpectrum Version 1.2
ML program for estimating mutation rates using cancer mutation databases. [Publication with Commentary]()

Source code for oncoSpectrum version 1.2 [Download](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/oncSpectrum.v1.2.tgz)

# Bayesian Phylogenetic Analysis with Site-specific Rates (BYPASSR)

Software for inferring the posterior distribution of site-specific rates using a gamma distribution prior without discretization and for inferring branch lengths on trees with DNA degradation (ancient DNA samples). [Publications with Commentary]()

Source code for BYPASSR available at Ligia Mateiu's [website](http://www.cmt.ua.ac.be/lcovaci/lucian/ligia/software.html)

## Ancient Software (Unsupported and not developed)

Software for maximum likelihood estimation of bacterial allele frequencies (replaces BFREQ program). Program written by Eric
Anderson. [Publications with Commentary]()
