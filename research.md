## Current Projects
### Tardigrade Population Genomics
[Tardigrades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade), or "water bears," are one of the most widespread and least studied groups on earth. They are microscopic animals (less than 1 millimeter in length) and are found in many different aquatic and semi-aquatic environments. They have been independently evolving for at least 500 million years having shared a most recent common ancestor with arthropods. Tardigrades are capable of withstanding extreme envionmental conditions and can undergo cryptobiosis, suspending their metabolism and potentially persisting in this dormant state for decades. They are an important part of the soil ecosystem in extreme regions such as antarctica. Tardigrades and nematodes are probably the earliest animal colonizers in new habitats created by volcanic eruptions or retreating glaciers. They are diploid and sexually reproducing (although parthogenesis also occurs) but little is known about their mode of dispersal or population genetic structure.

The first tardigrade genome was sequenced in 2015. I am working with collaborators [Byron Adams](http://lifesciences.byu.edu/Directories/FacultyStaff/ctl/FacultyProfile/mid/5712/NetID/BJA43) (Brigham Young University) and [Carl Johansson](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carl_Johansson2) (Fresno City College) to assemble two additional genomes: one for a eutardigrade and the other for a heterotardigrade. We are analyzing next-generation sequence data from pooled samples (hundreds of individuals) for each species. This allows us to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for subsequence population genetic analyses in addition to obtaining the genome assemblies. We will study the phylogenetic relationship (and divergence times) between species in these two major groups. This research aims to simultaneously delimit species boundaries, determine phylogenetic relationships, and measure population genetic structure. This is a very challenging statistical problem and one role of my lab is to develop methodologies for "deep diversity" studies that allow the hierarchical structure of species, populations and individuals to be discovered using genomic sequencing data alone. Such techniques are essential for new initiatives (such as the [Earth Biogenome Project](https://www.earthbiogenome.org/)) now on the horizon aiming to sequence the genomes of all life on earth.
