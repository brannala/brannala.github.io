The repository contains the source code for Bruce Rannala's lab website. The website is hosted on github using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static website generator. Jekyll code is automatically rendered as a static site by GitHub Pages. We will not consider pull requests from anyone other than lab members!
