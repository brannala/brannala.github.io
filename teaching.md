### EVE 231. Principles of Biological Data Analysis

(3) Lecture--2 hours; laboratory--3 hours.
Introduction to the principles of data analysis, experimental design,
statistical modeling, inference, and hypothesis tests. Statistical
methods of particular importance in biological applications will be
emphasized. Examples will be presented from the fields of ecology and
evolutionary genetics. 

[Draft of 4 chapters of a book](http://rannala.org/books/EVE231Notes.pdf "EVE 231 Notes") (based on notes developed for EVE231) 

### EVE 131. Human Genetic Variation and Evolution 

(3) Lecture—3 hours. Prerequisite: Biological Sciences 1B or
2B. Introduction to genome-wide nucleotide sequence variation in human
populations and computational methods for its analysis. Topics to
include forensics, disease gene mapping, and studies of human
evolutionary history. Misuses, such as eugenics, and ethical/legal
issues will be discussed. [EVE 131 Course Notes](http://rannala.org/books/EVE131CourseNotes.pdf "EVE 131 Course Notes")(Partial) 

### MCB 10. Introduction to Human Heredity 

(4) Lecture—3 hours; discussion—1 hour. Topics in human heredity and human gene
structure and function, including the genetic basis of human
development, causes of birth defects, mental retardation, genetic
diseases, sexual determination, development, and behavior. GE credit: SciEng.
